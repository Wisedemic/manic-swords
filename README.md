## About

This project was made as exercise to learn React.js and improve our skills with Javascript.
We used [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.

WORK IN PROGRESS

## Main Challenges

1. Dynamic drawing in HTML5 Canvas updated each animation frame.
2. Move player in synchronous in both user screen via POST server request and Socket IO.
3. Constantly think about performances and how to improve it.
4. Full-stack JS application with NodeJS as Backend.
5. Authorization using Feathers.
6. Managing the data flow with React-redux.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/project; npm install
    ```

3. Start your app

    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Testing

Simply run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g feathers-cli             # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers generate model                 # Generate a new Model
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
